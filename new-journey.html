                        Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp 
                        to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects 
                        and meet like-minded peers.

               <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
               <p2>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and 
                hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                work new techniques into existing projects.

                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was 
                learning and most things about my journey with the world.
                </p2>
                <h3>How I got started</h3>
                <p2>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would 
                    take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, 
                    I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write 
                    short summaries of what I learned using my own words.

                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting 
                    my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
